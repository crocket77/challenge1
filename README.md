Here are the changes that I made in index.html HTML:
Updated webpage title,
added header, nav, footer, and section HTML semantics
added alt attributes to all images
changed <h2> to <h4> in the footer


Here are the changes made in style.css:
I decided to combine multiple classes because styling declarations were replicated and part of the same parent container.
Multiple font declarations needed quotes around them. I renamed or edited classes to match HTML revisions.
