Here are the changes that I made in index.html HTML:
Updated webpage title
added <header>
added <nav> to header
added alt attributes to all images
defined footer as <footer>
changed <h2> to <h4> in the header


Here are the changes made in style.css:
I decided to combine multiple classes because styling declarations were replicated and part of the same parent container.
multiple font declarations needed quotes
I renamed or edited classes to match HTML revisions.
